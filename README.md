* [FIX94](https://github.com/FIX94) for creating many of the GameCube save file exploits, in which a lot of code from them is used in this project.
* [Gaberboo](https://github.com/Gaberboo) for providing a lot of useful information that was used to create this exploit, as well as providing the original solution to a cache problem that was preventing this exploit from being made.
* [Seeky](https://github.com/SeekyCt) for adding onto Gaberboo's solution by providing a simpler solution.
* [Dex](https://twitter.com/le_dex_sms) for testing this project's exploit on an actual console.

## Overview
This is a save exploit for Frogger Beyond. This exploit will load a `boot.dol` converted with `dol2gci` (included in `Home Bros.`) from either of the memory card slots (starting from slot A).

## Usage
Either download a pre-hacked GCI from the [releases page](https://github.com/Zephiles/fb-exploit/releases), or pass a Frogger Beyond GCI to the included Python script to apply the exploit to it. Note that this exploit will be applied to the first file in the GCI, and there is no guarentee that other files will work after this. Furthermore, the code included in the exploit uses at least two file slots, so playing/saving with other slots may cause the exploit to no longer work.

**Important note for European players: When the game prompts you to select a language, you MUST select English!**

Once you have the GCI file with the exploit, use a Homebrew app such as [GCMM](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/GCMM) to put both this project's GCI file and the `boot.dol` GCI file onto your memory card. Once the files are on your memory card, you are free to boot up the game like normal. To trigger the exploit, simply load the first file at the file select screen. Upon trying to select it, the exploit will trigger.

## Prerequisites
`devkitPPC` (can be found [here](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started))  
`Python 3` (can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). Note that 3.8.1 in particular was used for testing the script in this project, but any version of 3 should work.

## Building
Once the prerequisites are installed, you must add **DEVKITPPC** to your environment, in which it should be set to the `devkitPPC` folder. Once this is done, run `make` in `\source\fb-hack`. This will build three separate `bin` files, which will be placed into the `bin` folder. You can also specify specific versions to build by adding additional rules, such as `make jp`, `make us eu`, etc. Once the `bin` files have been built, move them to `bin` folder at the root of this project.

Once the `bin` files are in place, you can pass a Frogger Beyond GCI to `SaveFileHack.py`, in which it will modify the GCI as stated in the `Usage` section.

## Licenses
A lot of files and code used in this project are from **FIX94**'s save file exploit projects, which are licensed under GNU GPL, version 2. Thus, that license is being used for this project.
